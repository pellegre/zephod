    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Last time I spoke with Randall, he was quite interested in a particular type of machines that\n",
    "initially were designed to solve a problem and while doing so they were catalyzing its own\n",
    "construction. He was pretty convinced that, as long as enough energy was around, any solvable\n",
    "problem could be solved in that way. I couldn't find flaws in his logic, and we pursued an\n",
    "exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, he pointed out that the machine will create (or better said, discover) new problems\n",
    "on it’s way and solve them with the sole purpose of collecting and storing energy. And again,\n",
    "he cleverly made a guess that different components of the machine will establish a symbiotic\n",
    "relation to parallelize the resolution of the problems and to reuse previous solutions when\n",
    "necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s how the concept of RIST was born, which was the most natural way to study the behavior\n",
    "of different parts of the machine over time. Something overlooked back then was the possibility\n",
    "that the machine became aware of itself, in the sense that a RIST will develop enough\n",
    "computing power to formulate a question about its nature of existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randall once joked about that. “Ha! What if the machine now knows that something exists?\n",
    "Is that a bug?”. And yes, consciousness was initially treated as a bug and it was used as\n",
    "a stopping criteria for whatever problem was being solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as a good friend of mine always says, a bug, it’s a feature. So we opened a new branch where\n",
    "we let consciousness develop freely in the machine whenever it was possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among other things, we found that the development of consciousness was quite different on\n",
    "each iteration, depending on the initial problem. But regardless of that genesis trigger,\n",
    "we found a set of problems that appeared over and over on every conscious instance of\n",
    "the machine that we created. We didn’t probe it, but we had a good intuition that the\n",
    "discovery of those problems is a necessary condition for consciousness to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we were skipping our arts class at that time, we couldn’t think of a more creative name\n",
    "than “Necessary Problems” for them. It was later changed to “Natural Problems” because no one\n",
    "worked on a proof for that yet. Not even the machine $\\zeta$\n",
    "\n",
    "And here it is Randy, look at what you did !\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prime Sieve Automata (PSA)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handcrafting the logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a language with an alphabet of \"1\" and \"0\" where natural numbers are expressed in the\n",
    "base-2 numeral system. For example, 2 it's represented as \"10\" and 11 as \"1011\". The automata\n",
    "we'll build is going to read the strings starting at the right most bit (least significant bit)\n",
    "of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the following function converts a natural number into the binary\n",
    "representation we'll work with."
